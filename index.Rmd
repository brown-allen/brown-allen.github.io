## Ph. D. Student | Organizational Behavior & Theory
**Tepper School of Business, Carnegie Mellon University**

|
|

I am a first-year doctoral student in Organizational Behavior and Theory at the Tepper School of Business studying the meso and macro structures at work within organizations and firms. My aim is to research processes and practices of (e)valuation and knowledge transfer, with special attention to the mediating effects of digital technologies and artificial intelligence(s).

Previously, I worked as the Director of Online Education at Wake Forest University, where I partnered closely with institutional leadership to plan, develop, and support online programs reflective of Wake Forestâ€™s institutional mission and values. My areas of professional interest included program development methods that support equitable outcomes for students, novel frameworks for conceiving of human-centered instructional design, and perceptions of learning data in higher education.
